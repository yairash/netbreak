# NetBreak

NetBreak, a Chrome extension, elevates your browsing experience by seamlessly extending it to offline usage.
As you navigate the web, NetBreak works in the background to archive visited pages and their content. 
When internet connectivity is lost, NetBreak offers instant access to previously downloaded pages in offline mode.
Additionally, NetBreak features the "Saved Pages Navigator," allowing you to efficiently access saved 
web pages without an internet connection.
NetBreak is integrated with SingleFile, an open-source utility. This integration empowers users to customize 
saved web content, including stylesheets, images, and fonts.
